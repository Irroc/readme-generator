# README Generator

## Description
The README Generator was made so the user can create a readme.ms file easily. When the program is ran using node.js the user is prompted by the terminal to answer all the questions about their project and will automatically create the generatedREADME.ms file for you to copy and past into your projects Readme.md file.

## Installation
Needed programs to use.
* Node.js
* Dont forget to use "npm install" in the terminal to install the dependencies.

## Usage
    After installing the dependencies, to use the README generator type in the terminal "node index.js" and the prompts will apear in the teminal one at a time. Follow all the prompts until it says 'README file made!'. Then navigate to the generatedREADME.md file and there you will have your readme all together with the propper syntax.
